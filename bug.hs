This code attempts to use `undefined` which is not a valid Haskell value.  Haskell's type system prevents this kind of error at compile time, but using undefined can lead to runtime errors if the program reaches the point where it tries to use the undefined value.

```haskell
myFunction :: Int -> Int
myFunction x = if x > 0 then x + 1 else undefined
```
