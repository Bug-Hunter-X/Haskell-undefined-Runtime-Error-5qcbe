This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Haskell resulting from the use of the `undefined` value. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.hs` provides a corrected version. The error occurs when the function attempts to use a value that has not been properly defined, leading to a runtime crash.  The solution showcases how to handle such cases gracefully, providing a more robust program.
